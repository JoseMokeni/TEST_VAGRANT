# API Unit Testing with Mocha, Supertest, and Express

This is a small project that demonstrates how to use Mocha, Supertest, and Express to test APIs. In the `server.js` file, you will find various test cases. You can uncomment the specific case you want to see in action.

**Note:** The test script can be found in `test/test.js`.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project, using the provided `.env.example` as a reference.
2. Install the required packages by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project.
3. To run the tests, use the command `npm run test`.
4. To run just the server, comment out the `module.exports` line in `server.js` and uncomment the `app.listen` block. Then, run the command `npm run server`.

Feel free to explore the code and the comments in the scripts to understand how everything works.

Happy testing!
